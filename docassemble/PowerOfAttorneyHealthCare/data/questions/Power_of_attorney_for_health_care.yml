  Instructions
subquestion: |  
  To use this program you will need to know:

  * The name, address, and phone number of the person you want to designate as the agent with power of attorney,
  * When you want to authorize the agent to start making decisions for you, and
  * What you want the agent to do about life-sustaining treatments and other health care issues.

  After you download your forms, you will need to sign the form establishing power of attorney in the presence of a witness. The witness will also need to sign the form. Then, you will want to give copies of the power of attorney to your agent as well as your health care providers. [**Read more about how to set up a power of attorney for healthcare**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/how-set-power-attorney-healthcare).

  About the Power of Attorney for Health Care
subquestion: |
  A Power of Attorney for Health Care is a form that lets you choose a person to make health care decisions for you. The person you choose will be able to make health care decisions for you when you can't make decisions for yourself.
  
  A few examples of possible decisions the person you choose can make include:
  
  * Medical treatment,
  * Admitting you to a hospital,
  * Making end-of-life decisions, and
  * Deciding what happens to your body when you die.

  **The quality of my life is more important than the length of my life.**
  If I am unconscious and my doctor (relying on accepted medical standards) believes that I will not wake up or recover my ability to think, communicate with my family and friends, and experience my surroundings, I do not want treatments to prolong my life or delay my death. However, I do want treatment or care to make me comfortable and to relieve me of pain.

  **I want my life to be prolonged to the greatest extent possible.**
  Staying alive is more important to me, no matter how sick I am, how much I am suffering, the cost of the procedures, or how unlikely my chances for recovery. I want my life to be prolonged to the greatest extent possible allowed by reasonable medical standards.
