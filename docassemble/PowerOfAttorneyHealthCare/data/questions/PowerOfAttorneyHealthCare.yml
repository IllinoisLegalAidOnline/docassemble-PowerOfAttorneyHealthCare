question: |
  About the power of attorney for health care
subquestion: |
  A power of attorney for health care is a form that lets you choose a person to make health care decisions for you. The person you choose will then be able to make health care decisions for you when you can't make decisions for yourself.
  
  A few examples of possible decisions the person you choose can make include:
  
  * Medical treatment,
  * Admitting you to a hospital,
  * Making end-of-life decisions, and
  * Deciding what happens to your body when you die.

  **The quality of my life is more important than the length of my life.**
  If I am unconscious and my doctor (relying on accepted medical standards) believes that I will not wake up or recover my ability to think, communicate with my family and friends, and experience my surroundings, I do not want treatments to prolong my life or delay my death. However, I do want treatment or care to make me comfortable and to relieve me of pain.

  **I want my life to be prolonged to the greatest extent possible.**
  Staying alive is more important to me, no matter how sick I am, how much I am suffering, the cost of the procedures, or how unlikely my chances for recovery. I want my life to be prolonged to the greatest extent possible allowed by reasonable medical standards.
