  Power of attorney for health care
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Power of attorney for health care** Easy Form.

  This program helps you create documents to give someone you trust power of attorney for your health care. This means they can make choices about your health care when you cannot. They will also have access to your health care information.
  
  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**setting up a power of attorney for health care**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/setting-power-attorney-healthcare).

question: |
  Instructions
subquestion: |  
  To use this program you will need to know:

  * The name, address, and phone number of the person you want to designate as the agent with power of attorney,
  * The names, address, and phone numbers of any successor agents,
  * When you want to authorize the agent to start making decisions for you, and
  * What you want the agent to do and not do regarding life-sustaining treatments and other health care issues.
    
  Set aside 5 to 15 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later. 
  
  ${ collapse_template(help_example) }  

  Click on **{green words}** to learn what they mean. Some questions have a question mark in a circle ${ fa_icon("question-circle", color_css="#0DCAF0" ) } that also gives help.

question: |
  Your next steps
subquestion: |
    After you download your forms, you will need to sign the form in the front of a witness. The witness will also need to sign the form. 
    
    You do not need to have two witnesses and get the document notarized, but it is best to do so. If only one witness signs, the power of attorney may not be recognized outside of Illinois. 
    
    After the form is signed, you will want to give copies of the power of attorney to your agent as well as your health care providers. 
    
    To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**setting up a Power of Attorney for Health Care**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/how-set-power-attorney-healthcare).

question: |
  About the Power of Attorney for Health Care
subquestion: |
  A Power of Attorney for Health Care is a form that lets you choose a person to make health care decisions for you. The person you choose will be able to make health care decisions for you when you can't make decisions for yourself. This written form is often called an "advance directive."
  
  A few examples of possible decisions the person you choose can make include:
  
  * Medical treatment,
  * Admitting you to a hospital,
  * Making end-of-life decisions, and
  * Deciding what happens to your body when you die.

  Your agent must be at least 18 years old. The agent does not have to be a family member but it should be someone you trust. You can select successor agents as backup if the first agent becomes unable to make these decisions.

  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**setting up a Power of Attorney for Health Care**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/setting-power-attorney-healthcare).

id: for yourself
question: |
  Are you making these forms for yourself?
subquestion: |
  In other words, are you the **{principal}** who wants to designate an **{agent}**?

  If you are making these forms for someone else, that person will be the principal.
fields:
  - no label: for_yourself
    datatype: yesnoradio
terms:
  agent: |
    The agent is the person who will make medical decisions for the principal if the principal is too ill to make or communicate their own choices.
  principal: |
    The principal is the person who chooses an agent to make decisions about the principal's medical treatment.
---
id: other principal notice
continue button field: other_principal
question: |
  Making a power of attorney for someone else
subquestion: |
  You can use this program for someone other than yourself, but:
  
  * That person must have directed you to make a Power of Attorney for Health Care, and
  * That person must choose what powers they want to give their agent.
  
   When you help someone make a Power of Attorney for Health Care form, you must follow their express wishes. If they cannot understand what they are signing or tell you their wishes, you should not use this program. 
  
  If you make a Power of Attorney for Health Care for someone else that does not follow their instructions, you could face legal consequences. You could be charged with forgery, which can be punished with jail time.

  **The quality of my life is more important than the length of my life.**
  If I am unconscious and my doctor (relying on accepted medical standards) believes that I will not wake up or recover my ability to think, communicate with my family and friends, and experience my surroundings, I do not want treatments to prolong my life or delay my death. However, I do want treatment or care to make me comfortable and to relieve me of pain.

  **I want my life to be prolonged to the greatest extent possible.**
  Staying alive is more important to me, no matter how sick I am, how much I am suffering, the cost of the procedures, or how unlikely my chances for recovery. I want my life to be prolonged to the greatest extent possible allowed by reasonable medical standards.
